# Unit Converter Mobile App

A units conversion app, specifically distance and weights, created as a helper when traveling abroad.  

Right now, specifically to the UK, (which I'm going to later this year).  

It will convert distance and weight measures from imperial to metric, and vice versa.
- meters <-> feet
- kilometers <-> miles
- grams <-> ounces
- kilograms <-> pounds (lbs)

There are 8 widgets shown on screen:  
- Text - contains "Enter a value to convert..." label
- TextField - for the starting value
- Text - contains "From" label
- DropdownButton - list selections for the starting measure
- Text - contains "To" label
- DropdownButton - list selections for the measure of the conversion
- RaisedButton - to call the method that will convert the value
- Text - to display the result of the conversion method

All the widgets are contained in a Column and are spaced and styled inside the Column children node.
